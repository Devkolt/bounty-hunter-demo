**GitHub Backend**

**Issues**
- GitHub Issues are used as a bounty tracker.
- Issues tagged as "bounty" are tracked and displayed on the site.

**Repo**
- The repository is automatically forked upon a user joining the bounty.

**Actions**
- GitHub CI is used as basic filtering for bounty submissions.

**Site Frontend**

Minimize the user's interaction with the GitHub interface.

**Payment**
- Payout of the bounty is handled on the site upon closing the issue.

**Evaluation**
- Automate the evaluation of submissions using CI (unit tests) and other tools (maybe LLMs?) to rate the responses before human review.
- Create a clean interface for code reviewers (automatic branching and open code in VSCode).
